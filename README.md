I uploaded a source code file for a Java project to demonstrate two instances of an ArrayList with 50000 elements being sorted with different input criteria.
What is happening within this project is that we are calculating and outputing the time it takes to sort each ArrayList using the nanoTime() method.
The first sort is using the selectionSort(List1) method while the second sort using the bubbleSort(List2) method.
We are then using the selectionSort() method to find the smallest number of element as well as the smallest index.
